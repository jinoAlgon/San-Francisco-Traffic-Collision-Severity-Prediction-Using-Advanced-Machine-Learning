# San Francisco Traffic Collision Severity Prediction

## Overview
This project uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict traffic collision severity in San Francisco. It aims to support the Vision Zero initiative to reduce traffic fatalities and severe injuries.

## Dataset
The dataset covers traffic collision records from 2005 to 2022 in San Francisco, providing a comprehensive view of the factors contributing to accident severity.

## Methodology
We employed clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, Expectation-Maximization), outlier detection (Local Outlier Factor), and classification (Random Forest, Decision Tree) models to analyze and predict injury severity.

## Results
Will Update Soon!
<!-- Our models provide insights into the key factors contributing to collision severity, aiding in strategic planning for safer roads. -->

## Usage
Instructions on how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the project are included.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to all contributors and organizations that supported this project.
